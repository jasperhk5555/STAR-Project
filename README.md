# STAR Project Analysis  
## Abstract
Through the well known dataset, Tennessee’s Student Teacher Achievement Ratio, this report will attempt to find an answer to the question “How Does Class Type Affect Students’ Math Achievement In Grade 1?”. Knowledge on which class type leading to better performance has an influence on a societal level. By using the predictors of class type (small, regular, regular+aide) and school, a two-way ANOVA model will be fit towards the median Stanford Achievement Test scores on math for each class of Grade 1s. The findings of the model shows that both class type and school has a significant effect on the math achievement of Grade 1s. To quantify the magnitude of influence, the Tukey Range Test concludes that small classes have a significant positive effect relative to regular and regular+aide classes. On the other hand, there is no significant difference between regular and regular+aide classes in terms of math achievements for Grade 1s.
